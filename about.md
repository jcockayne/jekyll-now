I am a second year PhD student at the University of Warwick, supervised by [Mark Girolami](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/girolami/). I am constructing methods for numerical solution of partial differential equations which return a probability measure [describing uncertainty due to discretisation error](http://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/). In particular I am interested in how this can be applied to incorporate error in the forward model into posterior distributions in Bayesian inverse problems.
