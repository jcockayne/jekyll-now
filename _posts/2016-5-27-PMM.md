My new paper, [Probabilistic Meshless Methods for Partial Differential Equations and Bayesian Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07811) (PMM for short) has just popped up on arxiv. This is work with [Chris Oates](http://oates.work), [Tim Sullivan](http://www.tjsullivan.org.uk/) and Mark Girolami.
