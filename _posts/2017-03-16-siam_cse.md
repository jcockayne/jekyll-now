title: "Video of SIAM CSE Talk"
---

My recent talk at SIAM CSE was recorded and has now been posted online. The talk is one I've given before, on the [probabilistic meshless methods paper](/papers/pmm). You can watch it [here](https://www.pathlms.com/siam/courses/4150/sections/5835/video_presentations/42666) if interested.
