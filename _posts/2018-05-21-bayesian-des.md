title: "On the Bayesian Solution of Differential Equations"
---

Junyang Wang, PhD student of Chris Oates, has just submitted a new paper on the Bayesian solution of ODEs to the arXiv. This draws a line under the debate over whether an exact Bayesian solution for an ODE can exist in general (under a Gaussian prior) so is definitely work a read. [Here's a link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07109).
