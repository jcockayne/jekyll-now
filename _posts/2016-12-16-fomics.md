The [FOMICS Winter School on UQ](https://www.ics.usi.ch/index.php/news/237-fomics-winter-school-at-usi-december-15-19-2016) is in full swing. I spoke yesterday, again about our work on [probabilistic meshless methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07811). The discussion was quite spirited, with lots of interest on the ideas behind the paper and probabilistic numerics in general! The slides are available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/fomics.pdf).
