Chris Oates and I recently presented our new paper, [Bayesian Probabilistic Numerical Methods](/papers/pn_foundations), in back-to-back talks at ICERM's workshop on probabilistic scientific computation. The two talks were filmed and are available online. Here's Chris with [Part 1](https://icerm.brown.edu/video_archive/#/play/1307) and me with [Part 2](https://icerm.brown.edu/video_archive/#/play/1308). All the other talks from the workshop are also available, and would make for a very educational binge-watch - see [here](https://icerm.brown.edu/video_archive/#/index).
